## Description
Udacity's FEND Project/Exercise Cat clicker as part of JS Design Pattern course to learn how to structure the code and build an organized application.

## Project Requirements 1

### Visuals
- The application should display a picture of a cat and a number of clicks.
- The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

### Interaction
- The number of clicks should increment when the cat picture is clicked.

## Project Requirements 2

### Visuals
- The application should display two cats. Each cat includes:
	- the cat's name
	- a picture of the cat
	- text showing the number of clicks
- The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

### Interaction
- The number of clicks should increment when the cat picture is clicked.

## Project Requirements 3

### Visuals
- The application should display:
	- a list of at least 5 cats, listed by name
	- an area to display the selected cat
- In the cat display area, the following should be displayed:
	- the cat's name
	- a picture of the cat
	- text showing the number of clicks
- The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

### Interaction
- When a cat name is clicked in the list, the cat display area should update to show the data for the selected cat.
- The number of clicks in the cat area should be unique to each cat, and should increment when the cat's picture is clicked.
